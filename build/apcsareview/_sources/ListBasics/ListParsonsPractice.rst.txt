Mixed Up Code Practice
------------------------------

Try to solve each of the following. Click the *Check Me* button to check each solution.  You will be told if your solution is too short, has a block in the wrong order, or you are using the wrong block.  Some of the problems have an extra block or two that aren't needed in the correct solution.  Try to solve these on your phone or other mobile device!

   The following program segment should be a class that adds some Strings of conversational phrases to List and then prints them out.  But, the blocks have been mixed up and include <b>one extra block</b> that is not needed in a correct solution.  Drag the needed code from the left to the right and put them in order with the correct indention so that the code would work correctly.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution.</p>
