About the Exam
----------------
    
This book is intended to help you review for the Advanced Placement Computer Science A Exam.  I hope to eventually make it a complete textbook for the course as well.  

For more information on the exam see https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-a/exam-practice. 

The exam has two parts and takes 3 hours.  The first part has 40 multiple-choice questions.  The second part has 4 free response questions were you have to write Java code by hand.  In the past the multiple choice question part was 1 hour and 15 minutes, but as of spring 2016 it will be 1 hour and 30 minutes.  The free response part will also be 1 hour and 30 minutes as of spring 2016.
