Conditional - Summary
-------------------------

In this chapter you learned about **conditionals**.  **Conditionals** are used to execute code when a Boolean expression is true or false.  A Boolean expression is one that is either true or false like ``x > 0``.

Concept Summary
=================

- **Block of statements** - One or more statements enclosed in an open curly brace '{' and a closing curly brace '}'.
- **Boolean expression** - A mathematical or logical expression that is either true or false.  
- **complex conditional** - A Boolean expression with two or more conditions joined by a logical and '&&' or a logical or '||'.
- **conditional** - Used to execute code only if a Boolean expression is true.
- **DeMorgan's Laws** - Rules about how to distribute a negation on a complex conditional.  
- **logical and** - Used to only execute the following statement or block of statements if both conditions are true
- **logical or** - Used to execute the following statement or block of statements if one of the conditions are true
- **negation** - turns a true statement false and a false statement true
- **short circuit evaluation** - The type of evaluation used for logical and '&&' and logical or '||' expressions.  If the first condition is false in a complex conditional with a logical and the second condition won't be evaluated.  If the first condition is true is a complex conditional with a logical or the second condition won't be evaluated.

Java Keyword Summary
=========================

- **if (Boolean expression)** - used to start a conditional statement.  This is followed by a statement or a block of statements that will be executed if the Boolean expression is true.
- **else** - used to execute a statement or block of statements if the Boolean expression on the if part was false.  
- **else if (Boolean expression)** - used to have 3 or more possible outcomes such as if x is equal, x is greater than, or x is less than some value.  It will only execute if the condition in the 'if' was false and the condition in the else if is true.
