Free Response - APLine
======================

    single: free response

The following is a free response question from 2010.  It was question 2 on the exam.  You can see all the free response questions from past exams at https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-a/exam-practice.

**Question 2.**  An `APLine` is a line defined by the equation *ax* + *by* + *c* = 0,where *a* is not equal to zero,*b* is not equal to
zero, and *a*, *b*, and *c* are all integers. The slope of an `APLine` is defined to be the double value *-a* / *b* . A point (represented by integers x and y) is on an `APLine` if the equation of the `APLine` is satisfied when those x and y values are substituted into the equation. That is, a point represented by x and y is on the line if
*ax* + *by* + *c* is equal to 0. Examples of two `APLine` equations are shown in the following table.

Assume that the following code segment appears in a class other than `APLine`. The code segment shows an example of using the `APLine` class to represent the two equations shown in the table.

.. code-block:: java

   APLine line1 = new APLine(5, 4, -17);
   double slope1 = line1.getSlope();        // slope1 is assigned -1.25
   boolean onLine1 = line1.isOnLine(5, -2); // true because 5(5) + 4(-2) + (-17) = 0

   APLine line2 = new APLine(-25, 40, 30);
   double slope2 = line2.getSlope();        // slope2 is assigned 0.625
   boolean onLine2 = line2.isOnLine(5, -2); // false because -25(5) + 40(-2) + 30 != 0

Try and Solve It
----------------

Write the `APLine` class. Your implementation must include a constructor that has three integer parameters that represent *a*, *b*, and *c*, in that order.
You may assume that the values of the parameters representing *a* and *b* are not zero.
It must also include a method `getSlope` that calculates and returns the slope of the line, and a method `isOnLine` that returns `true` if the point represented by its two parameters (x and y, in that order) is on the `APLine` and returns `false` otherwise.
Your class must produce the indicated results when invoked by the code segment given above.
You may ignore any issues related to integer overflow.
