           The following code should calculate the cost of a trip that is 300 miles if gas is $2.50 a gallon and your car gets 36 miles per gallon.  However, the code has syntax errors, like missing semicolons, wrong case on names, or unmatched ``"`` or ``(``.  Fix the code so that it compiles and runs correctly.

           Line 5 is missing a semicolon.  Line 6 has ``Double`` instead of ``double``.  Remember that the primitive types all start with a lowercase letter.  Line 8 has ``tripmiles`` instead of ``tripMiles``.  Remember that you should uppercase the first letter of each new word to make the variable name easier to read (use camel case).

        .. tab:: Answer
        
           Line 5 has ``Height`` instead of ``height``.  Remember that variable names should start with a lowercase letter.  Line 6 is missing an equal sign.  Line 7 is missing a ``*`` to square the height.  Line 8 is missing a semicolon at the end of the statement.

        .. tab:: Question
  
           Write the code to print the number of chicken wings you can buy if you have $4.50 and they cost $0.75 each.  Remember that you can't buy part of a wing. 
           
           .. activecode::  ch3Ex10q
              :language: java
   
              public class Test1
              {
                  public static void main(String[] args)
                  {
                      
                  }
              }


        .. tab:: Answer
        
           Divide the amount of money you have by the cost of each wing and set the result to an integer since you can't buy a part of a wing.
